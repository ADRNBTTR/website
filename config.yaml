      With over 15 years of experience as a Fullstack developer, my true passion has always centered on backend optimization, data management, and databases. As soon as the opportunity arose, I undertook a 3-month certified training to deepen my skills in data engineering. Since then, I've been consistently training, primarily through Udemy and Datacamp, showcasing my ongoing dedication to the world of Data.

      Recently, I have further augmented my professional qualifications by achieving a B2 certification in the IELTS English language assessment, underscoring my ability to engage in an international work environment effectively.

      Currently involved in a project for my end-of-studies dissertation as part of an evening engineering course, I am actively seeking opportunities with a strong focus on Data.
